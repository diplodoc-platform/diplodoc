Diplodoc Platform is open platform for work with your documentation in accordance with "Documentation as a Code" paradigm.

Simple and comfortable solution for everyone.

## Advantages of the platform

### Ease of Use

Manage documents as if they were source code: in a familiar environment with minimal deployment and maintenance effort.

### Flavored Markdown

Use enhanced markdown with necessary documentation components like code blocks, images, diagrams, and more.

### Combine handwritten and generated documentation

Create comprehensive documents manually while also integrating automatically generated content from OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) definitions. Custom includerâ€™s interface allows creation of any kind of autogenerated docs (JavaDoc, etc..)

### Ready for Translations

The platform natively supports text extraction for various translation systems such as SmartCAT, Weblate, YaCAT, and Yandex Translate.

### Single source publishing

Use advantage of single source publishing, enabling the creation of multiple similar document versions from a single source text for consistent and efficient content management.

### Page Constructor

The platform natively supports [Page Constructor](https://github.com/gravity-ui/page-constructor), allowing users to enhance individual documentation pages with carousels, backgrounds, smoothly animated cards, and various other blocks, as well as create landing pages. 

### Right-to-Left

Diplodoc offers  the advantage of supporting Right-to-Left (RTL) mode, ensuring seamless access and readability for languages such as Arabic and Hebrew.

### Integrated Search Functionality

## Adding/removing subrepositories in the monorepo

To add/remove subrepositories in the monorepo, use the scripts `script/check-submodules.sh` and `script/add-submodules.sh`.
1. Run the script: `script/check-submodules.sh`. It will update the `submodules.conf` file. If necessary, manually make corrections in the `submodules.conf` file by specifying the correct path.
2. Run the script: `script/add-submodules.sh`. It will add/remove subrepositories according to the `submodules.conf` file.
3. Push the result to the repository.

As a result, you should see new subrepositories in the list of subrepositories on GitHub, and your `.gitmodules` file will be updated (and it will already be sorted)
